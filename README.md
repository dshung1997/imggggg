# IMGGGGG !

---

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but was ejected and customized.

---

## Requirements

- Node: `^10.14.0` (as @gotitinc/design-system requires `^8.0.0` or `^10.0.0`)
- Yarn (preferable)
- This project uses a private package from Got It, Inc. If you don't have access to that, please don't try to clone and install this repo. And if you're given access, take your token from `~/.npmrc` (it should be `//registry.npmjs.org/:\_authToken=(NPM_TOKEN)` after you logged in), and export it in `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`: `export NPM_TOKEN=...`
